                            <div>In this class, I applied transfer theories and research on digital writing, aiming to (1) help students learn to reapply (transfer) what they learn beyond the classroom; (2) develop students’ ability to write for digital media. Key concepts that facilitate transfer such as rhetorical situation, audience awareness, and genre conventions were enhanced and expanded. Additionally, this course introduced students to fundamental principles and practices of multimedia design and digital writing. Guided by these principles, students completed a website project, a video, and Wikipedia entry. This pedagogy supports lifelong learning and writing across disciplines.</div>
